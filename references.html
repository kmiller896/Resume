    Kelvin worked for me for over two years while I was the head of the ITO tooling team that provided installation and configuration of performance monitoring tools.
  </p>
  During our time together he became my team lead handling all aspects of Introscope including installations and version validations.
  <p>
    Kelvin spent many additional hours working with teams during the post installation process to tune the tool for the specific needs of an application.
  </p>
  I was sorry to see him leave during a tooling consolidation but I continued to contact him when I had a need to install or modify an application configuration in my current position of Application Production Support Manager.
  <p>
    I highly recommend Kelvin for any position and would not hesitate to rehire him should the opportunity present itself.
